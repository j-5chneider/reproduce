# Containerization and version management
![](www/version.jpg){.top-img}  
\

R and python use additional extensions ("packages") to expand their basic functions for data analysis. However, differences in the **versions** of these packages can create compatibility issues, even when researchers are using the same version of R of python. Packages like `renv` and `groundhog` for R help to keep these versions consistent.
  
Beyond package management, maintaining compatibility across **system requirements** — such as operating systems and software versions — is critical for ensuring portability. Containerization tools like Docker and the `holepunch` package for R provide solutions by encapsulating scripts and their dependencies into isolated environments. To what extent JASP and jamovi will be backwards compatible in the future is not entirely clear.
  
To tackle **both challenges** simultaneously, the `rix` package offers an integrated solution, combining system requirements management with package version control to streamline reproducibility efforts.

### Advantages {.unnumbered}


-   Data analysis is sustainable over longer period of time
-   Equal system environment between researchers
-   Equal package versions between researchers


### First easy steps {.unnumbered}

I recommend **starting with** ensuring the compatibility of **package versions**.

* If you want your workflows and particularly those of others to be altered the least, `groundhog` may be the better option (only minimal alterations with both)
* In case you are using packages installed from github, `renv` may be the even more robust option (both are relatively robust)

Once you are confident in managing packages, you can proceed to address system requirements, such as standardizing software versions. See "Free resources" for `holepunch` and `rix` below.

#### You {.unnumbered}
1. **Only once:**  
Install `renv` by running
```{r}
install.packages("renv")
```

2. **Once per project:**  
Make sure you work within an R-project (and not with single files)!  
Initiate `renv` by running
```{r}
renv::init()
```

3. **Only in case you installed new packages:**  
Document these new packages by running
```{r}
renv::snapshot()
```

4. **Now share your project with others** (e.g. via [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), [GitHub](https://github.com/), email)

#### Others {.unnumbered}
1. Install `renv` by running
```{r}
install.packages("renv")
```
2. Open the project they received from you
3. To have the same package versions available, others need to run
```{r}
renv::restore()
```

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" title="Package management with groundhog (for R)"}
1. **Only once:**  
Install `groundhog` by running
```{r}
install.packages("groundhog")
```

2. **When starting RStudio:**  
Load `groundhog` package by running
```{r}
library(groundhog)
```

3. **When writing a script:**  

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="49%"}
You can replace this
```{r}
library(rio)
library(dplyr)
```
:::
:::{.column width="2%"}
:::
:::{.column width="49%"}
with this using e.g. today's date
```{r}
groundhog.library("
  library(rio)
  library(dplyr)   ", "2025-01-28")
```
:::
::::

In contrast to `renv `, **others do not need to know anything** about `groundhog`. They can run your script, that will automatically install and load the specific packages.
