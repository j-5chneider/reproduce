# Containerization and version management

R and Python use additional extensions ("packages") to expand their basic functions for data analysis. However, differences in the **versions** of these packages can create compatibility issues, even when researchers are using the same system. Packages like renv and groundhog for R help address this by maintaining consistent versions, ensuring that analyses remain accessible and reliable over time.
  
Beyond package management, maintaining compatibility across **system requirements**—such as operating systems and software versions—is critical for ensuring portability. Containerization tools like Docker and the Holepunch package for R provide solutions by encapsulating scripts and their dependencies into isolated environments. This approach preserves the original system configuration, enabling reproducibility of analysis scripts across different platforms. To what extent JASP and jamovi will be backwards compatible in the future is not entirely clear.
  
To tackle **both challenges** simultaneously, the rix package offers an integrated solution, combining system requirements management with package version control to streamline reproducibility efforts.

### Advantages {.unnumbered}


-   Data analysis is sustainable over longer period of time
-   Equal system environment between researchers
-   Equal package versions between researchers


### First easy steps {.unnumbered}

The management of packages and software versions is particularly relevant **for R and Python**, as **users have the ability** to ensure compatibility themselves. In contrast, whether older JASP or Jamovi project files can be opened in newer software versions depends largely on the decisions of the software developers, leaving users with limited control.  

I recommend **starting with** ensuring the compatibility of **package versions**. Once you are confident in managing this, you can proceed to address system requirements, such as standardizing software versions.

:::{.column width="49%"}
#### You {.unnumbered}
1. **Only once:**  
Install `renv` by running
```{r}
install.packages("renv")
```

2. **Once per project:**  
Make sure you work within an R-project (and not with single files)!  
Initiate `renv` by running
```{r}
renv::init()
```

3. **Only in case you installed new packages:**  
Document these new packages by running
```{r}
renv::snapshot()
```

4. **Now share your project with others** (e.g. via [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), [GitHub](https://github.com/), email)
